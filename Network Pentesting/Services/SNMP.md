- **UDP 161**
- SNMP has 3 versions v1, 2c and 3, with version 3 being the most secure with usernames & password authentication and encryption. However, configuration is very complex and we still see v2c exist a lot: no encryption, authentication with community strings.
- Config File: `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`

Enumerating SNMP
```jsx
snmp-check <IP>
```
Query all the OIDs with their information
- try default `public` community string
```jsx
snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community_strings> <IP>
```
Brute-forcing community strings
```jsx
onesixtyone -c <wordlist> <IP>
```
(nmap) Snmp nmap scripts 
```bash
nmap -sU -p 161 --script=smnp-* 
```
### Metasploit
Enumeration
```jsx
